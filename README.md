## 👉 What is Machine Learning

Let's define it first in a simple way as [Arthur Samuel](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Samuel) described in 1959:
<br>
>  _🤖 Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed 🤖_

<br>

The modern definition is by [Tom M. Mitchell](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_M._Mitchell):

>  _🤖 A computer program is said to learn from experience <b>E</b> with respet to some class of tasks <b>T</b> and performane measure <b>P</b>, if its performance at tasks in <b>T</b>, as measured by <b>P</b>, improves with experience <b>E</b> 🤖_
