## 🤖 What is Machine Learning

Let's define it first in a simple way as [Arthur Samuel](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Samuel) described in 1959:
<br>
>  _👉 Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed_

<br>

The modern definition is by [Tom M. Mitchell](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_M._Mitchell):

>  _👉 A computer program is said to learn from experience <b>E</b> with respet to some class of tasks <b>T</b> and performane measure <b>P</b>, if its performance at tasks in <b>T</b>, as measured by <b>P</b>, improves with experience <b>E</b>_
<br>
🧑🏻‍💻 Example: playing checkers <br>
<b>E</b> is the experience of playing many games of checkers<br>
<b>T</b> is the task of playing checkers<br>
<b>P</b> is the probability that the program will win the next game<br>
